                Students are taught data communications concepts in both Computer
                Networks and Mobile Communication Systems/Networks. First the
                layered architecture of a network is discussed, and then fundamental
                concepts related to Signal are taught. These concepts are then related
                with bandwidth, data rate, encoding and modulation of the signals.
                Different error detection and correction schemes along with flow control
                are discussed. Finally, different communication protocols are discussed
                in detail.
